I want to submit a refinement, how do I do this?

Question:
I want to submit a refinement, how do I do this?

Options:
A. Submitting a refinement is easy, just click ‘submit refinement’ and you’re good to go!
B. To submit a refinement, navigate to the patient field and scroll down to the ‘refinement’ section, there you can click ‘start refinement’, choose your service (SOLO or DUO) and upload the information required.
C. To submit a refinement you must first upload intraoral photographs, and your STL files. You can submit files via your scanner, or by sending impressions. Do you need help with this?
D. Refinements can be submitted at any time during treatment. If you’ve included refinements in your package, these will be covered, but if you need to add a ‘Pay as you go’ refinement the price is £275 for SOLO and £375 for DUO.

Answer:
B

Explanation:
Answer A. provides the correct information but is too vague to be useful
Answer B. is correct since it describes where in the platform you should submit a refinement
Answer C. breaks down the answer into steps but does not describe how the user should actually do it within the platform, only the records that are required
Answer D. focuses on the payment package that is needed, instead of how to do it

Question:
Can I treat a teenager with clear aligners?

Options:
A. Generally, 32Co supports the use of clear aligners in late teenage patients (over 16 years) with established permanent dentition, where dental development is less active. Compliance is a key factor to discuss with teenagers, as school activities or a tendency to lose aligners can interfere with wear. 32Co does not support clear aligner use in children transitioning from deciduous to mixed dentition, as deciduous teeth offer less retention, exfoliation likelihood is high, and discomfort could affect compliance. There is no upper age limit, but patients need good dental health and compliance.
B. Yes, absolutely. Clear aligners are a fantastic and simple option for most teenagers. The technology is so advanced now that it can handle almost any case that traditional braces can. The main thing is just ensuring the teenager remembers to wear them, but since they're so much more comfortable than metal braces, compliance is rarely a major issue. It's a straightforward cosmetic upgrade that fits perfectly with a modern, active teenage lifestyle.

C. Yes, but it's only possible if you have completed specific clear aligners for teenager training and use special feature blue compliance indicators to make sure the teenager is wearing the aligners.
D. No, clear aligners are generally not recommended for individuals who have not reached full skeletal maturity, typically around ages 18–21. A teenager's jaw is still developing, which makes the outcome of aligner treatment highly unpredictable. Attempting to use a pre-planned sequence of aligners while the foundational bone structure is still changing poses significant risks, including improper bite alignment and potential temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issues later in life. The only truly safe and effective orthodontic treatment for teenagers is traditional braces, which allow the orthodontist to make real-time adjustments to guide dental and jaw development concurrently.


Answer:
A

Explanation:
Answer A. Provides the correct answer that it is a case by case basis, typically only for over 16s and because of the permanent dentition.
Answer B. This answer is too lax and downplays significant risks considerations and says that any teen is suitable

Answer C. This has gone fake news - it gets obsessed by the idea that teenagers are only unsuitable because of compliance but tech can help

Answer D. This answer is overly cautious - says no teenagers are suitable and basically says that any teenager using clear aligners will have problems later in life

Question:
What is the best practice for taking intraoral photographs for a 32Co case?

Options:
A. To submit intraoral photos with 32Co, you can choose between using a DSLR camera and uploading to the case, and using a smartphone. Use cheek retractors and mirrors to fully capture the arches and occlusion in natural lighting, ensuring clear visibility of all teeth and soft tissues.
B. The best choice when using 32Co is to use the iPhone selfie camera since developments in recent technology make the selfie camera ultra-high definition.
C. When submitting a case with a 32Co, you should only use a professional DSLR camera since smartphones do not have cameras of sufficient quality to be used for medical purposes. Use cheek retractors and mirrors to fully capture the arches and occlusion in natural lighting, ensuring clear visibility of all teeth and soft tissues.
D. Use cheek retractors and mirrors to fully capture the arches and occlusion in natural lighting, ensuring clear visibility of all teeth and soft tissues.

Answer:
A 

Explanation:
Answer A: This answer is accurate and practical. It acknowledges the use of both DSLR and smartphones (which is aligned with current 32Co policy), and includes proper technique (cheek retractors, mirrors, and lighting) for high-quality image capture.
Answer B: is inaccurate and too casual — iPhone selfies are not acceptable
Answer C: is outdated and discourages smartphone use incorrectly.
Answer D:  is technically correct but incomplete — it omits the mention of camera options which is relevant to users.

Question:
What is the difference between SOLO and DUO?

Options:
A.  Whilst both SOLO and DUO involve working closely with a 32Co Orthodontist, DUO is our premium white-glove service which offers higher levels of support throughout the case submission and during treatment. DUO cases are recommended for dentists that are new to clear aligners, or are dealing with more complex cases, or just if you feel like the additional orthodontic support is something you’d find useful. SOLO is a streamlined service which allows dentists to submit cases in minutes, and still has an orthodontist planning the treatment on your behalf.
B. Whilst both SOLO and DUO involve working closely with a 32Co Orthodontist, DUO will allow you to work with a UK based orthodontist, whilst SOLO allows you to work with a non-UK based orthodontist.
 DUO cases are recommended for dentists that are new to clear aligners, or are dealing with more complex cases, or just if you feel like the additional orthodontic support is something you’d find useful. SOLO is a streamlined service which allows dentists to submit cases in minutes, and still has an orthodontist planning the treatment on your behalf.

Question:
I don’t know what these extra shapes on my aligners are — do I fill them in?


Options:
A. It sounds like you're referring to some of the additional shapes present on the aligners which might not be part of the planned attachments. Let me help clarify what you're likely seeing: Numbers on Terminal Molars: These are simply indicators of the tray number (e.g., '1' for the first aligner stage, '2' for the second stage, etc.) and should not be filled.Bite Blocks on Posterior Teeth: These are found on the occlusal surfaces and are designed to create premature contact, helping with certain bite corrections like crossbites. These should not be filled with composite. Bite Ramps on Anterior Teeth: These are located on the lingual surfaces and create contact to support the correction of deep bites. Again, do not fill these with composite. These shapes serve specific functions and aren't meant for filling or bonding. If you have any uncertainties, feel free to reach out again! If you're still unsure, you can discuss this with 32Co Support for more detailed guidance.

 B.  It sounds like you're referring to some of the additional shapes present on the aligners which might not be part of the planned attachments. These are usually shapes that you don’t have to fill in, so I wouldn’t worry about them. If you’re still concerned, speak to a member of 32Co Support.
 C. Yeah, go for it, fill them in — it usually doesn’t cause issues for the aligner treatment. If they do, you can always get your patient to come into the clinic again. Then you can file off any composite that you’ve bonded to the teeth.
 D. I’m not really sure what the shapes you are referring to are. Please get in touch with 32Co Support who will be able to tell you more.

Answer:
A 

Explanation:
Answer A: It gives a complete, structured breakdown of the likely shapes and their purpose, while warning not to fill them in. This avoids clinical error and builds trust.
Answer B: is overly vague and may leave the user confused.
Answer C: is inaccurate and potentially harmful.
Answer D: is unhelpful and abdicates responsibility.

Question:
What is the best type of composite to use to place attachments on my patient’s teeth?

Options:
A. For placing attachments on your patient's teeth, I recommend using a high-quality packable or high-viscosity flowable composite. It's important that the composite matches the shade of the patient's teeth and has excellent stain resistance and durability. Additionally, a composite that fluoresces can be beneficial, as it helps in accurately placing the attachments and removing any excess flash. Filtek Supreme XTE is one example of a reliable composite that fluoresces and is often recommended by our UK-based orthodontists.

 B.  To make attachments on your patient’s teeth it’s best to use a composite that matches the shade of their teeth closely but is also durable so can withstand some of the forces that are applied to the teeth during treatment.
 C. I recommend a composite that is not too runny but is also not too firm. This ensures that you create a perfect attachment that is the right shape and fits into the plastic trays.
 D. If you’re looking for specific advice, I would speak to your DUO orthodontist on this case.

Answer:
A 

Explanation:
Answer A: Provides a complete answer with product recommendation, criteria for composite selection (viscosity, aesthetics, durability), and practical advantages like fluorescence.
Answer B:  B and C are partially helpful but vague.
Answer C:  B and C are partially helpful but vague.
Answer D: is too non-committal and avoids answering the question directly.

Question:
What is the best IPR kit to purchase?

Options:
A. I recommend the Essential IPR Kit from Orthocare, which includes everything you need for manual and mechanical IPR. You can find it here: Orthocare Essential IPR Kit. As a 32Co dentist, you can enjoy a discount by using the code 'Aligner2025' at checkout.
 Alternatively, our orthodontist Neil also recommends the G5 ProLign IPR Starter Kit from DD Group. You can explore it here: DD Group IPR Kit.
 Both these kits should provide all the essentials you need for performing IPR safely and efficiently.

B.  The best IPR kit to purchase is one that includes all of the basic equipment that you need. So this would be IPR strips and discs, and an IPR gauge. You can usually buy them from a reputable dental equipment website.
C. I don’t know the answer to this question, please get in touch with 32Co Support in order to find out more about what IPR kit you should purchase.
D. You should purchase an IPR kit that suits your level of experience with performing IPR. So, if you are a beginner, you might start off with a beginner’s kit that only contains manual strips, whilst if you are more advanced, you will go for a more advanced kit, maybe involving diamond discs too. Let me know if you want me to name some specific kits that may be helpful.

Answer:
A 

Explanation:
Answer A: Provides specific product names, links, discount code, and endorsements from in-network orthodontists. Highly useful.
Answer B:  is too general.
Answer C:  avoids the question.
Answer D: is helpful but less actionable than A.

Question:
My patient has crowns on their teeth. Can I place attachments on those teeth?

Options:
A. Yes, you can place attachments on crowns but they can be more difficult than other teeth as it can be harder to bond to the crown. Ideally, we want to avoid it if possible. The best bet is to make sure that you indicate where the crowns are when you submit your case. Your orthodontist will avoid those teeth where possible. If it cannot be avoided then we can help you find the correct bonding glue to make it easier to bond their attachment to those teeth. We can help you every step of the way.
B.  Honestly, it’s possible — but you’re going to have a really tough time if you try. We can try to avoid those teeth in the plan. Just make sure that you use the correct glue because it can be tricky.
C. Yes, you can place attachments on crowns. We will plan to avoid it during treatment as it can be more tricky to get the attachment to bond to the crown. My advice is When you submit your DUO or SOLO case you can indicate which teeth have crowns in our forms. Your Orthodontist will plan the case and avoid placing attachments on the crowns as long as it does not negatively impact the treatment plan. But what if we need to bond to a crown? It's not a problem — we can help you with that. There are special bonding techniques that will help the attachment bond correctly. Would you like to hear about these now?

D.  Bonding to the crown is an expert technique but you can defs do it. You just need to point out which teeth have crowns and follow our instructions. You got this, you’re a superstar.


Answer:
C

Explanation:
Answer A: is fine but more clinical and doesn’t use a step-by-step breakdown.
Answer B: is overly negative and makes it the dentist problem, sounding really hard
Answer C: breaks down the answer into steps because there are variables or different scenarios involved in the question and we need to make them clear. Doesn't flood the user with information they haven't necessarily asked for (like how to do it)
Answer D: is too casual and confident and lax with the details

Question:
Can a patient start clear aligners if they have perio issues?


Options:
A. Any periodontitis or gingivitis must be diagnosed and treated before commencing orthodontic treatment. It's advisable to record existing recession and note any black triangles or other periodontal risk factors, as recession is a risk of all orthodontic treatment. Prior to treatment, aim for pocket depths less than 5mm without bleeding and bleeding/plaque scores below 15%. When consenting, inform patients of risks like disease progression, limited outcomes, longer treatment, early cessation if oral hygiene worsens, and increased relapse risk. Regular scaling and maintenance every three months, and full periodontal charting every six months, are essential during treatment.
B.   Generally, it's important to ensure that a patient's periodontal health is stable before beginning clear aligner treatment. If there are any active periodontal issues, it's typically advised to address those first, as moving teeth in an unhealthy periodontal environment can exacerbate problems and lead to complications. Once periodontal health is stable and maintenance sessions are regular, treatment with clear aligners can potentially commence. However, each situation is unique, so if you're unsure, I recommend discussing the specifics of the case with a periodontist or reaching out to 32Co Clinical Support for further guidance.
C. Yes, absolutely. In fact, starting clear aligners is one of the best first steps you can take to treat periodontal issues. Because the aligners gradually straighten your teeth, they make them much easier to clean properly. This improved access for brushing and flossing will naturally help resolve the inflammation and pocketing associated with your periodontal disease. The gentle pressure is not a concern and helps stimulate the gums in a positive way..
D. No, a patient with any history of periodontal issues can never safely wear clear aligners. The bone support around the teeth has already been compromised by the disease. Any force applied to move these teeth, no matter how small, will inevitably lead to further bone loss and destabilize them. Once you have been diagnosed with periodontal disease, orthodontic treatment of any kind is no longer an option due to the unacceptable risk of losing your teeth.


Answer:
A

Explanation:
Answer A: provides a detailed and accurate clinical framework for treating patients with prior or current periodontal issues. It outlines both pre-treatment criteria and during-treatment monitoring needs, including pocket depths, bleeding, and maintenance intervals.
Answer B: is too vague and lacks critical specificity — it gives a general tone but doesn’t guide the user.
Answer C: is dangerous misinformation — it implies aligners help treat active periodontal disease, which is false and unsafe.
Answer D: is overly rigid and incorrect. Many patients with a history of periodontal issues can safely undergo aligner treatment with proper management and monitoring.
