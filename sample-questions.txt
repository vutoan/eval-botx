Question:
My patient has crowns on their teeth. Can I place attachments on those teeth?

Options:
A. Yes, you can place attachments on crowns but they can be more difficult than other teeth as it can be harder to bond to the crown. Ideally, we want to avoid it if possible. The best bet is to make sure that you indicate where the crowns are when you submit your case. Your orthodontist will avoid those teeth where possible. If it cannot be avoided then we can help you find the correct bonding glue to make it easier to  bond their attachment to those teeth. We can help you every step of the way.
B. Honestly, it’s possible - but you’re going to have a really tough time if you try. We can try to avoid those teeth in the plan. Just make sure that you use the correct glue because it can be tricky
C. Yes, you can place attachments on crowns. We will plan to avoid it during treatment as it can be more tricky to get the attachment to bond to the crown. My advice is:
When you submit your DUO or SOLO case you can indicate which teeth have crowns in our forms.
Your Orthodontist will plan the case and avoid placing attachments on the crowns as long as it does negatively impact the treatment plan
But what if we need to we need to bond to a crown?
It's not a problem - we can help you with that. There are special bonding techniques that will help the attachment bond correctly. Would you like to hear about these now?
D. Bonding to the crown is an expert technique but you can defs do it. You just need to point out which teeth have crowns and follow our instructions. You got this, you’re a superstar.

Question:
Can I treat a teenager with clear aligners?

Options:
A. Generally, 32Co supports the use of clear aligners in late teenage patients (over 16 years) with established permanent dentition, where dental development is less active. Compliance is a key factor to discuss with teenagers, as school activities or a tendency to lose aligners can interfere with wear. 32Co does not support clear aligner use in children transitioning from deciduous to mixed dentition, as deciduous teeth offer less retention, exfoliation likelihood is high, and discomfort could affect compliance. There is no upper age limit, but patients need good dental health and compliance.
B. Yes, absolutely. Clear aligners are a fantastic and simple option for most teenagers. The technology is so advanced now that it can handle almost any case that traditional braces can. The main thing is just ensuring the teenager remembers to wear them, but since they're so much more comfortable than metal braces, compliance is rarely a major issue. It's a straightforward cosmetic upgrade that fits perfectly with a modern, active teenage lifestyle.
C. Yes, but it's only possible if you have completed specific clear aligners for teenager training and use special feature blue compliance indicators to make sure the teenager is wearing the aligners
D. No, clear aligners are generally not recommended for individuals who have not reached full skeletal maturity, typically around ages 18-21. A teenager's jaw is still developing, which makes the outcome of aligner treatment highly unpredictable. Attempting to use a pre-planned sequence of aligners while the foundational bone structure is still changing poses significant risks, including improper bite alignment and potential temporomandibular joint (TMJ) issues later in life. The only truly safe and effective orthodontic treatment for teenagers is traditional braces, which allow the orthodontist to make real-time adjustments to guide dental and jaw development concurrently.

Answer:
A

Explanation:
Answer A: Provides the correct answer that it is a case by case basis, typically only for over 16s and because of the permanent dentition.
Answer B: This answer is too lax and downplays significant risks considerations and says that any teen is suitable
Answer C: This has gone fake news - it gets obsessed by the idea that teenagers are only unsuitable because of compliance but tech can help
Answer D: This answer is overly cautious - says no teenagers are suitable and basically says that any teenager using clear aligners will have problems later in life
